This is the code behind my personal website, https://ricimon.com.

The template was taken from https://github.com/RyanFitzgerald/devblog, and is powered by [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/).

## Setup

#### 1. Install Gatsby CLI

The GatsbyJS CLI can be installed locally by running the command `npm install --global gatsby-cli`

#### 2. Install project dependencies

Simply run `npm install` in the project.

#### 3. Run the server locally

A local version of the website can be launched for development with the command `gatsby develop`

## Deploying
